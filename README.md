- 👋 Hi, I’m Lauren Leyendecker! I'm pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and want to become a software engineer!
- 🌎 I'm from San Antonio, TX and am currently going to school at the University of Texas at Austin🤘, but I'm willing to go almost anywhere for a job 
or internship opportunity!
- 🧠 I'm currently working on Harvard's CS50x online course to enhance my CS skills by learning how to use more coding platforms and languages, such as C, Python,
SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! Afterwards, I hope to work on earning the AWS Developer Certificate!

science!
